# TimeMachine for CentOS 7 Docker Image #

## Introduction ##

A docker image for Time Machine&trade; based on
[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) 7 Linux with the
[S6](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/index.html) process superviros.

Time Machine from
[SolutionSoft Systems, Inc.](https://www.solution-soft.com) is a software 
product providing virtual clocks that enable you to time travel your
applications into the future or the past, facilitating time shift
testing on your date and time sensitive application logic, such as
month end, quarter end, year-end processing, billing cycle, work flow,
regulatory go live, and policy life cycle.

Time Machine is transparent to applications and databases so no
code modification is required to do time shift testing and the system
clock is never modified. Time Machine eliminates the need to
reset the system clock, which is time consuming, error prone and not
possible under Active Directory, in a Kerberos secured or SSL enabled
environment.

TimeMachine for Docker enables time travel in docker
containers by providing a collection of Docker images with Time
Machine installed.

## Using Time Machine in Docker containers ##

To use Time Machine with Docker containers, a host copy of Time
Machine should be first installed on the main host system that run the
containers. It is a prerequisite for running of Time Machine in
the containers successfully as containers share the same address space
as the host.

No license for this host Time Machine is needed, unless time
travel is also required for the host system (in addition to
containers).

In case that containers will be running on multiple hosts, each of
those hosts must have host Time Machine installed as well.

You can download host version of Time Machine from the
following FTP location:

`ftp://ftp.solution-soft.com/pub/tm/docker/Linux/redhat/`

In the same location, you'll also find a
`tm_linux_docker_host_readme.txt` file that explains the installation
steps in more details.

This host version of Time Machine also has the Time Machine
Floating License Server (TMFLS) bundled with it, and it is
automatically installed along side with Time Machine on the
host.

TMFLS will provide licensing for Time Machine in the containers
you'll create. To enable TMFLS, you will need to acquire a license key
from SolutionSoft Systems, Inc.

Please refer to the file `tm_linux_docker_host_readme.txt` on how to
install Time Machine and to license & configure TMFLS.

## Creating containers with Time Machine pre-installed ##

After Time Machine is installed on the host(s), to create
containers that will use Time Machine, you can use *Solution-Soft* 
provided docker images that have Time Machine already
installed and are available from the Docker Hub.

To check the list of currently available Time Machine docker
images, please check the *Solution-Soft* docker hub at:

`https://hub.docker.com/u/solutionsoft`

To download and use any of the available container images, click on
the desired image name, and once the page of that image appears, look
at the description of the Docker Pull Command needed to be executed on
your host to download the image. Also, please check for any additional
relevant info in the Overview section (if available), with regards to
the usage of the image.

For example, to download the latest Time Machine image for
CentOS 7 (assuming you have docker service already installed and
running on your host), you would need to run:

`# docker pull solutionsoft/timemachine-for-centos7:latest`

Each of the available docker images has Time Machine
preinstalled, and configured to use a license from a TMFLS. It is
typically served from the host on which the containers are running.

TMFLS target is specified by the environment variables `TM_LICHOST`,
`TM_LICPORT` and `TM_LICPASS`. `TM_LICHOST` is the IP address of the
host on which TMFLS is running. `TM_LICPORT` is the TCP port number to
communicate with TMFLS and the default value is 57777. `TM_LICPASS` is
the security code that must match the security code from TMFLS and the
default value is "docker".

Before creating a container from the preconfigured image, we first
need to create a directory on the host to keep the persistent data for
a container, since Time Machine stores some persistent data
(such as log files, or persistent virtual clocks info). Let's assume
we'll use directory `/var/tm/tmdata1` for the TMAgent persistent data
and logs. To create such a directory, use the following command:

`# mkdir -p /var/tm/tmdata1`

We can then use the following command to start/create a container in a detached mode:

```
# docker run -d --rm \
  -e TM_LICHOST=192.168.20.112 \
  -e TM_LICPORT=57777 \
  -e TM_LICPASS=docker \
  -p 17800:7800 \
  -v /var/tm/tmdata1:/tmdata \
  solutionsoft/timemachine-for-centos7:latest
```

This will return a hash string representing the detached container
ID. For example:
`edd7e405dba37c871e115ffefd96e1329a3aad1fe811c95a00cd14296aa794ef`.

Some explanation here:

1. as described above, we use environment variables `TM_LICHOST`,
`TM_LICPORT` and `TM_LICPASS` to allow Time Machine in the
container to automatically check out a license from TMFLS; In this
example 192.168.20.112 is the IP address of the host that runs the
containers, and at the same time TMFLS.

2.  TMAgent port 7800 inside the container is mapped to 17800 in the
local machine;

Please note that when creating containers from the Docker images, for
each running container you need to make sure to map a different
available port from the host to the port 7800 in the container. Time
Machine Agent (Time Machine component) from the container will
listen on that port for remote requests from the Management Console
and other products from the Time Machine Suite.

3. local directory `/var/tm/tmdata1` is mapped to `/tmdata` in the
container, where we keep the TMAgent persistent data and logs.  Please
note that when running multiple containers on the same host, you need
to map different directories on the host to store persistent data for
each container.

The host TMFLS is pre-configured with default listening port value of
57777 and security key 'docker'. It means that, by default, you will
only need to pass on to the container the environment variable for the
actual IP address of your host (which is also the the IP address of
TMFLS), while the values for the Listening Port (57777) and the
Security Key ('docker') would match without the need for a change. Of
course, if you want to change the values for the listening port and
the security key, you can do so by passing on all three environment
variables (just like it is done in the example above).

As soon as you create/run the container, the license is checked out
from the TMFLS, and you can create virtual clocks in that
container. How many licenses from TMFLS can be used simultaneously
depends on the size of TMFLS License Unit Pool.

You can use the following command to check the container status:

```
# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
edd7e405dba3        timemachine-for-centos7:latest   "/init"             4 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        7800/tcp            keen_buck
```

With the container running in the background, you can spawn a shell
session to the container and check from the inside:

```
# docker exec -it edd7e405dba3 /bin/bash
[root@edd7e405dba3 /]# cd /opt/solutionsoft/timemachine/
[root@edd7e405dba3 timemachine]# cat licserverhost
192.168.20.112:57777:docker
[root@edd7e405dba3 timemachine]# cd /tmdata
[root@edd7e405dba3 tmdata]# ls -R data
data:
_db.dat
[root@edd7e405dba3 tmdata]#
```

To stop the container, run the following command:
	
`# docker container stop edd7e405dba3`

As soon as you stop the container, the license is released back to the
TMFLS, and it will become available to another container.

If you want to create multiple containers with docker run command
(like described above), you will need to run the command each time for
a new container, changing the host port value and host directory that
need to be mapped to the new container.


## Manage Time Machine containers using docker-compose ##

Beside using the command docker run to create containers from
preconfigured images that have Time Machine preinstalled, you
can also use docker-compose tool to easily create multiple containers
with Time Machine running, using a single command.

Docker-compose is a tool provided by Docker to define and operate
single or multi-container applications.

For further reference, please go to: `https://docs.docker.com/compose`

According to its design, one should use a YAML file to specify the
application instance. By default, this YAML file takes the name
'docker-compose.yml'.

In the following example, we will show how to use docker-compose to
define a single and multiple Docker/Time Machine configuration. We
will assume that all the containers will run in the current working
directory.


### Single Application Configuration ###

This is a single Time Machine docker configuration:

```
# mkdir ./tmdata
# cat docker-compose.yml
version: '3.1'

services:
	tm:
		image: solutionsoft/timemachine-for-centos7:latest
		container_name: timemachine-for-centos7
		restart: always
		environment:
  			- TM_LICHOST=192.168.20.112
  			- TM_LICPORT=57777
  			- TM_LICPASS=docker
		ports:
  			- "17800:7800"
		volumes:
  			- "./tmdata:/tmdata"
```

To start this instance:

`# docker-compose up -d`

To stop this instance:

`# docker-compose down`


### Multiple Application Configuration ###

Let's assume that we will configure three applications, with their
persistent data stored at `./tmdata1`, `./tmdata2`, `./tmdata3`,
respectively.  In addition, their TMagent listening ports will be
17800, 27800 and 37800, respectively.

```
# mkdir -p ./tmdata1 ./tmdata2 ./tmdata3
# cat docker-compose.yml
version: '3.1'

services:

	one:
		image: solutionsoft/timemachine-for-centos7:latest
		container_name: timemachine-for-centos7-1
		restart: always
		environment:
  			- TM_LICHOST=192.168.20.112
  			- TM_LICPORT=57777
  			- TM_LICPASS=docker
		ports:
  			- "17800:7800"
		volumes:
  			- "./tmdata1:/tmdata"

	two:
		image: solutionsoft/timemachine-for-centos7:latest
		container_name: timemachine-for-centos7-2
		restart: always
		environment:
	      - TM_LICHOST=192.168.20.112
	      - TM_LICPORT=57777
	      - TM_LICPASS=docker
		ports:
	  		- "27800:7800"
		volumes:
	  		- "./tmdata2:/tmdata"

	three:
		image: solutionsoft/timemachine-for-centos7:latest
		container_name: timemachine-for-centos7-3
		restart: always
		environment:
  			- TM_LICHOST=192.168.20.112
  			- TM_LICPORT=57777
  			- TM_LICPASS=docker
		ports:
  			- "37800:7800"
		volumes:
  			- "./tmdata3:/tmdata"
```

To start all the applications:

`# docker-compose up -d`

To stop all the applications:

`# docker-compose down`

To start one application `two`:

`# docker-compose up two -d`

To stop one application `three`:

`# docker-compose down three`

Please note that applications `one`, `two` and `three` will all be
operating in the same docker subnet.

## Operate Time Machine inside the Container ##

Once you have containers with Time Machine running, to manage Time
Machine inside the containers, you can use a docker command to spawn a
shell session to a respective container and issue Time Machine
commands from the command line:

`# docker exec -it edd7e405dba3 /bin/bash`

Fo your convenience, a container created from Solution-Soft
preconfigured docker images has a single existing user called
time-traveler, and a user group of the same name:

```
[root@edd7e405dba3 /]# id time-traveler
uid=999(time-traveler) gid=998(time-traveler) groups=998(time-traveler)
```

This user can be used 'out-of-the-box' to test Time Machine
functionality, and assigning a virtual clock to that user would be
done as in the example below:

```
[root@edd7e405dba3 /]# tmuser -a -u time-traveler -y 6
# this command time shifts the user time-traveler 6 years into the future

Copyright(c) 1997 - 2019 SolutionSoft Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Time Machine tmuser utility version 12.9R3 for Linux Kernel 2.6 or up,
for managing virtual clocks at the command line.

tmuser: uid 999 has been added with a Running virtual clock: Wed Apr 23 09:36:41 2025
```

To check what virtual clocks are currently existing on your system:

```
[root@edd7e405dba3 /]# tmuser -l
Copyright(c) 1997 - 2019 SolutionSoft Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Time Machine tmuser utility version 12.9R3 for Linux Kernel 2.6 or up,
for managing virtual clocks at the command line.

tmuser: report: Listing all virtual clocks:
Id         Clock type                Clock date/time
u:time-traveler Running                   Wed Apr 23 09:38:03 2025

- End of list -
tmuser: All Time Machine users have been listed above.
```

To double check that the user actually sees virtual time, you can do
the following:

```
[root@edd7e405dba3 /]# su time-traveler
bash-4.2$ date
Wed Apr 23 09:41:34 UTC 2025
```

At the same time, other users are unaffected by the virtual time:

```
bash-4.2$ exit
exit
[root@ee2cbfbeafca /]# date
Tue Apr 23 09:43:41 UTC 2019
```

To delete the virtual clock and revert user time-traveler to system
time, you can run the following command:

```
[root@ee2cbfbeafca /]# tmuser -d -u time-traveler 
Copyright(c) 1997 - 2019 SolutionSoft Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Time Machine tmuser utility version 12.9R3 for Linux Kernel 2.6 or up,
for managing virtual clocks at the command line.

tmuser: report: Virtual clock for uid 999 has been deleted
```

You can also use the Time Machine Management Console (Java based
GUI that comes bundled with Time Machine on the host) to manage
Time Machine in each of your containers. See Time Machine
Management Console documentation for more details (by default located
under `/etc/ssstm/tmconsole/` on the host).

So, for example, if you're running three containers on your host, by
mapping host's ports 17800, 27800 and 37800 to redirect the traffic to
respective containers' port 7800, you'll be able to connect your Time
Machine Management Console to all three in parallel, choosing
Time Machine Agent type of connection and using the following
connection strings, respectively:

```
localhost:17800

localhost:27800

localhost:37800 
```

Once you connect to a container via Time Machine console, you'll
be able to create virtual clocks for OS users and affect all processes
running under those users (among others, the processes of DB or App
servers for example).

Please note that initially, the user time-traveler will be hidden in
the Console, and to assign a virtual clock for such a user, please
refer to Time Machine Management Console user manual, located
under `/etc/ssstm/tmconsole/` on the host. Adding such users is
specifically described in *SECTION 3. LOCAL TIME MACHINE MANAGEMENT*,
*subsection C. CONFIGURE VIRTUAL TIME FOR OS GROUPS AND USERS*.

If your containers span multiple hosts, then you can use an enhanced
version of the Console, called Time Machine Enterprise
Management Console to manage them all from a Windows system with one
console.

You can download the Enterprise Console from the following FTP
location:

`ftp://ftp.solution-soft.com/pub/tm/tmconsole/enterprise/`

In the same directory, you can find a readme-tmconsole-enterprise.txt
file, that explains how to install and license it. Once installed, a
detailed manual is also available in the installation folder.

With the Enterprise Console, you would use slightly different
connection strings to connect to our example containers, specifying
the actual IP of the host on which they are running (in this example
it is 192.168.20.112):

```
192.168.20.112:17800

192.168.20.112:27800

192.168.20.112:37800
```

The Enterprise Console offers additional capabilities such as creating
virtual clocks for specific processes (PIDs), in that way providing
more granularity, for example if you want to only time travel a DB
Server instance, and not the other processes owned by the user that
also owns the DB instance.

It also allows you to connect from a single control point to multiple
hosts that have containers, unlike the regular console that can only
connect to the host on which it is running.

Also, if Linux host that runs containers, does not have X Window
System enabled to run a GUI such as regular Time Machine
Console, it could be more convenient to use any Windows machine to
remotely manage Time Machine in the containers via the Enterprise
Console.

To read more about Time Machine Enterprise Management Console,
please refer to:

`https://solution-soft.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/TM%20Enterprise%20Management%20Console_4.pdf`

In a situation when you need to simultaneously time travel multiple
containers, you would use another product from Time Machine Suite,
namely Time Machine Sync Server.

Let's assume a scenario where you have containerized a multi-tiered
environment, and you have your DB Server, App Server and your
client-side all in separate containers. In such a scenario, if you
needed to time travel all three simultaneously, you would use the Sync
Server to group together containers into a single Sync Group and time
travel the whole group to a desired virtual time.

The Sync Server also has a built-in comprehensive URL API that
provides the ability to set virtual time and manage a Sync Group
programmatically. You can make a HTTP or HTTPS call to the API as part
of an automated testing script to enable the Sync Group, then proceed
through the scripted test case(s), change the virtual time for the
Sync Group to accommodate the next date centric test cases and when
virtual clocks are no longer needed, the Sync Group can be disabled
via the API.

Like with all the other products from the Time Machine Suite, Time
Machine Management Console (either regular or Enterprise
version) is used as a GUI to manage the Sync Server as well.

You can download Time Machine Sync Server from the following FTP
location:

`ftp://ftp.solution-soft.com/pub/tm/tmsync/`

After you open the above location in a browser, you can traverse
through the available directories to choose the OS where you want to
install it. When you locate the desired directory, next to the install
package, you'll find a readme_tmss.txt file that explains how to
install and license the Sync Server.

Once installed, a detailed manual is also available in the
installation folder.
